# Reverse an array arr[]. Reversing an array means rearranging the elements such that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes second last and so on.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]  
# Output:  [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
# Explanation: The first element 1 moves to last position, the second element 4 moves to second-last and so on.

# Input: arr[] = [4, 5, 1, 2]
# Output: [2, 1, 5, 4]
# Explanation: The first element 4 moves to last position, the second element 5 moves to second last and so on.


def reverseArray(arr):
    return arr[::-1]


print(reverseArray([1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]))
